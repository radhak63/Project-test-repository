## A brief overview of our chosen topic and rationale for picking it

The Open Data 500 is the first comprehensive study of U.S. companies that use open government data to generate new business and develop new products and services. Open Data is free, public data that can be used to launch commercial and nonprofit ventures, do research, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems.
The Open Data 500 study is conducted by the GovLab at New York University with funding from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The GovLab works to improve peopleâ€™s lives by changing how we govern, using technology-enabled solutions and a collaborative, networked approach. As part of its mission, the GovLab studies how institutions can publish the data they collect as open data so that businesses, organizations, and citizens can analyze and use this information.
The datasets that we use for this project was obtained from GovLab through Kaggle.  These data sets have information about US Companies that use the public data from various federal and state agencies.

By using the interactive dashboards, we want to provide the users the facility to explore the information about 500 US companies by selecting the company categories that uses public data from selected government agencies.
